# MapArchives
User-generated maps that I've been collecting since May of 2020 (and of course, 2021).
Does not use the **Pixel Warfare: Pro** client as a map fetcher.

If someone had more map collections than mine, please let me know in my youtube channel.

## How do I got these maps?
I mostly use the developer tools in the chrome browser and capturing network requests there. I pick websocket packets as they are the heart of this multiplayer game. After I joined a room, I simply save the network captures as a .har file after the map finished loading and extract the map data inside the file.

Sometimes I use my own [server implementation](https://www.github.com/Alto1772/pw5-data-server) (mitm attack-like) to download some downloadable maps without wasting data.

## Example Format

```
Map_4033-34881701417277768000[------------001------------]
```
### Where
| Name | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Map Name | Max 16 characters long | `Map_4033` |
| Random ID | Generated by client | `34881701417277768000` |
| Map Type | Deathmatch (001), Team Deathmatch (002), Zombie (003) | `[------------001------------]` |

# Update
I managed to upload the old map repository to the [internet archive](https://archive.org/details/PW5-Maps) if something causes damage to this.
