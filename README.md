# MapArchives
Pixel Warfare 5 Maps that I collected during May of 2020.
Does not use the **Pixel Warfare: Pro** client as a map fetcher.

May well preserved here because the data hosted on the server is not public and it mabye almost lost to time if not downloaded on their servers. 

If someone had more map collections than mine, please let me know in my youtube channel.

## How do I got these maps?
I mostly use the developer tools in the chrome browser and capturing network requests there. I pick websocket packets as they are the heart of this multiplayer game. After I joined a room, I simply save the network captures as a .har file after the map finished loading and extract the map data inside the file.

Sometimes I use my own [server implementation](https://www.github.com/Alto1772/pw5-data-server) (mitm attack) to download some downloadable maps without costing internet data.

## Example Format

```
Map_4033-34881701417277768000[------------001------------]
```
